# Learning to learn with backpropagation of Hebbian Plasticity

This is the source code for an upcoming paper. We implement three tasks: pattern completion, one-shot learning, and reversal learning.



The BOHP algorithm optimizes both the weight and the
plasticity of network connections. As a result, networks "learn how to learn" in order to solve tasks in unpredictable or changing environments.

More details coming.
